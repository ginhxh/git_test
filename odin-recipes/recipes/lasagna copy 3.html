    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The secret to these awesome chicken enchiladas is in the seasonings! I
      whipped these up on my own using ingredients I had on hand. Shredding the
      chicken is the most time-consuming step, but it's worth it in the end.
      Serve with sour cream and a side of Spanish rice. Give these babies a try!

        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly coat a
        3-quart baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.

        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add pasta and cook, covered, for
        the minimum time according to package directions. Drain and transfer to
        a large bowl.

        Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion,
        carrots, and celery; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until
        carrots are just tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Add zucchini and garlic. Cook
        and stir 1 minute more.

        Add carrot mixture, beans, tomatoes, green beans, tomato sauce, 1/4 cup
        Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper to the bowl of

      <li>step 6</li>
      <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil and top with
        mozzarella cheese; continue baking until heated through and cheese is
        melted,10 to 15 minutes. Top each serving with remaining Parmesan cheese
        and sprinkle with fresh herbs.
